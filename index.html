		    <h2>Testimonial Layout</h2>
			<img src="images/testimony.png" alt="Testimonial Layout"/>
			<h3>What I Hope To Learn</h3>
			<p>What I hope to learn from this component is how to expand on the idea of a simple image slider. This
				component takes user testimonials and displays them in an image slider styled showcase. Again, I think
				this is a unique way to display this information, compared to just some boxes of information this is
				interactive and clean looking.
			</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have or Will Learn in WDD</h3>
			<p>This relates to WDD because it expands on the simple image slider we built in PWA. This takes the
				basic slider we built and expands on it with enhanced styling and content.
			</p>
			<h3>How Might I Build This?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>This could be built using the following elements and made interactive with JavaScript or jQuery.</h4></li>
				<li>Create the component using a <span class='code'>section</span></li>
				<li>Title using a <span class='code'>h2</span> or <span class='code'>h3</span></li>
				<li>The subtitle appears to just be a <span class='code'>p</span> element with a heavier font weight.</li>
				<li>The left/right arrows could be images using the <span class='code'>img</span> tag, a font based icon, or ASCII content</li>
				<li>The main image, like the arrows, could be an <span class='code'>img</span> tag or a CSS background element.</li>
				<li>The customer name could be a <span class='code'>h5</span> or <span class='code'>h6</span> element.</li>
				<li>The customer review area could be created with a <span class='code'>p</span> element</li>
				<li>Lastly, the read more button could be created with a <span class='code'>button</span> element.</li>
			</ul>
				<h3>Style Guide</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The font appears to be Roboto Condensed with two font weights, 300 and 700.</li>
				<li>The following colors are used:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Background:#31383a</li>
						<li>Main Title:#ffffff</li>
						<li>Subtitle:#93989a</li>
						<li>Customer Name:#ffffff</li>
						<li>Customer Review:#777d7f</li>
						<li>Horizontal Rule:#f14d4d</li>
						<li>Button:#ffffff</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		    <h2>Product Grid</h2>
			<img src="images/productgrid.png" class="blog-img" alt="Product Grid"/>
			<h3>What I Hope To Learn</h3>
			<p>With this component I hope to learn a little more about grids. I know there are various ways to create
				different styles of grids, but I feel like they are an important tool to have some knowledge of.
				Grids seem to be used more and more to display information in unique and easy interfaces. I hope to
				focus and learn more about, specifically, CSS flex grids.
			</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have or Will Learn in WDD</h3>
			<p>Grids are becoming an important tool to display products, articles, and information. They are used to
				show importance, or lack of importance, based on layouts and size. Grids, like a grid of equals, can
				show that all the information is equally as important or, through size, draw attention to one item.
				It is important for UI development because it helps give the user a direction and some knowledge at
				first glance of where to go.

		    <h2>CTA With Multiple Backgrounds</h2>
			<img src="images/bg.png" class="blog-img" alt="CTA With Multiple Backgrounds"/>
			<h3>What I Hope To Learn</h3>
			<p>With this component I hope to learn more about background properties. This CTA uses an image and two
				different color overlays, which looks really unique and well done. I want to learn more about ways to
				create overlaying patterns, colors, and shapes with CSS and I think this is a good place to start.
			</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have or Will Learn in WDD</h3>
			<p>We have learned the basics of creating a CTA and CSS background properties. I think exploring options
				like this is the next step in creating truly unique work that stands out from other sites. Adding
				something like this seems like a natural progression from a CTA with just an image or color background
				to multiple backgrounds mixed together for a unique landing.

		    <h2>Newsletter Form</h2>
			<img src="images/signup.png" class="blog-img" alt="Newsletter Form"/>
			<h3>What I Hope To Learn</h3>
			<p>I thought this newsletter signup was interesting. It was placed in the footer and uses transparent
				form elements. I didn't realize you could set form elements to be transparent so this caught my eye.
				I hope from this I will learn a little bit more about styling form inputs and creative ways to use them.
				I think with the right background transparent inputs can be done really well and it is something I haven't
				seen too much.
			</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have or Will Learn in WDD</h3>
			<p>This relates to user interfaces and different ways to make the interface unique. We have spent time working
				on inputs and form styling, focusing on making them unique or modern. An example of this is using CSS
				frameworks and trying to style those inputs in a way that they do not look like every other Bootstrap,
				Foundation, or Skeleton page. This style of input would be an easy way to distinctly change your form
				inputs.

		    <h2>Featured Article Layout</h2>
			<img src="images/newarticle.png" class="blog-img" alt="Featured Article Layout"/>
			<h3>What I Hope To Learn</h3>
			<p>What I liked about this layout was the combination of other components I picked out. This uses grids
				and transparent, it seems like, buttons or links. I hope from this I can learn more about grids and
				inputs and different ways to use them. I like the featured article layout of this component and how
				it is larger than the other articles, which is something I would like to learn how to do.
			</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have or Will Learn in WDD</h3>
			<p>Again, I think this really ties into UI/UX design. Grids are an easy way to display information in a
				way that inheritly implies importance and are being used more and more. I think this will be an
				important area to not only understand but understand how to make the grids stand out and take on a
				unique look and style. Combining grids with other techniques from the components I choose will help
				to create a more enjoyable user experience and further my skillset.
